    ! These subroutines are essentially an adaptation/translation in  !
    ! Fortran of the code presented by Professor Svanberg originally  !
    ! programmed in Matlab (http://www.smoptit.se).                   !
    ! The model parameters are defined in the first lines of the      !
    ! MMA_Main.f90 and MMA_variables.f90 files.                       !
    !                                                                 !
    ! If you download and use the code, Professor Svanberg would      !
    ! appreciate it if you would send him an email telling him who    !
    ! you are and what your plan is (the email address is on his      !
    ! website). Additionally, the user should reference Professor     !
    ! Svanberg's academic work when the work is published.            !
    !                                                                 !
    ! Note: for the execution of the code it is necessary to have the !
    !       Lapack library, since the subroutines need the SGESV and  !
    !       DGESV functions, additionally a makefile is presented to  !
    !       facilitate the compilation and execution.                 !
